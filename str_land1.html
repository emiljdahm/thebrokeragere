      <h1>How we created a Short-Term Management Company that Generates 50k+ a Month.</h1>
      <h2>Our Story: Why We Started?</h2>
      <p>It all started when Patrick and I were working in real estate sales. We worked together for a long time and, like any real estate broker in the early stages of their career, the income fluctuated significantly. In some months I made close to $40,000, while in others I had negative earnings. If you have ever been in sales, then you know it's a bit of a nail-biter when you first start. However, we weren't twenty-somethings anymore. Patrick, who had become a new dad, and I, who was recently married, needed to find a way to earn a living while providing our families with some stability!

        I used to do traditional rentals in the past, and while it was okay and mainly served as an additional service for my existing clients, it rarely made sense for me financially. I was getting a flat percentage, but most of these homes were at least 1 hour away in a city where I had no connections and were located in a bleak part of town. I remember receiving calls from tenants at 1 am because they had broken their washer machine and were upset with me because I was the landlord, expecting me to be a plumber/and or appliance repairman at that very moment. It was quite awful, but it turned out to be beneficial for me and Patrick in the long run when he invited me to be a part of his growing Airbnb business, which along with our similar experiences in the business became our number one rule.
        
        That rule is to predict the future and then implement the necessary systems.
        
        If you didn’t scoff and immediately leave, here is what I mean, I am not saying be right about the future but you need to notice recurring problems and implement systems to reduce friction.</p>
